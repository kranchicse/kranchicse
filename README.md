# ATM_Interface 


Launched a Project | ATM Interface System

Iâ€™m excited to share the ATM Interface project I recently developed as part of my learning journey at Government College of Engineering, Yavatmal (CSE).

Project Overview: This is a console-based ATM simulation system built using Java. It offers basic banking features that simulate real-world ATM operations.

Key Functionalities:

Secure Login using Card Number and PIN verification

Balance Inquiry

Withdraw Cash (with sufficient balance check)

Deposit Cash

Change PIN (validates old PIN)

Mini Statement (displays last 5 transactions)


# Advantages:

Provides a practical understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Enhances skills in user input handling, conditional checks, and data storage

Mimics real ATM behavior for educational use

Builds a strong foundation for banking system simulations


# Output Snapshot:

User enters a 4-digit PIN

Navigates through the ATM menu

Performs operations like checking balance, deposits, withdrawals, and more

Outputs updated balance and transaction details
